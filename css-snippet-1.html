This is UGLY and also pretty hard to read.</span></p><p><img src="https://caro401.github.io/data/eww-nasty-code.png" /></p><p><span>Turns out, CSS has a nice way around this - tell the element to add a scroll bar when the thing is too wide. This looks like:</span></p><pre class="language-css"><code class="language-css">pre {
  overflow-x: auto;
}
</code></pre><p><span>The other options are </span><code>visible</code><span> (the default one) which makes the content spill out of its box, </span><code>hidden</code><span> which truncates it at the boundaries, and </span><code>scroll</code><span> which makes there always be a scrollbar if your OS says so. I was originally bitten by the fact that MacOS hides scrollbars, so set it to </span><code>scroll</code><span> and then looked at the site on Linux and realised it had a scrollbar regardless of whether one was actually required. </span><code>auto</code><span> means one is added only when you actually need it.</span></p><p><span>I also learned that </span><code>pre</code><span> is HTML element which wraps code blocks in the way this site is implemented, and is for putting "preformatted text" in, i.e.Â text that is meant to be displayed as it is in the HTML file. There's also </span><code>code</code><span> for inline code.</span></p><p><span>MDN docs for </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overflow-x" target="_blank">overflow-x</a><span> HTML </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/pre" target="_blank">pre element</a><span> and </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/code" target="_blank">code element</a><span>.</span></p></section></div></article></main></body></html>
