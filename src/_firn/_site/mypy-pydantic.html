It will also throw errors at runtime if you try to construct a pydantic model from something that doesn't fit the type.</span></p><p><span>However, the company also tries to use native Python type hints, and is starting to actually check them using </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" target="_blank">MyPy</a><span>. Turns out, if you have a Pydantic model, i.e.Â something that inherits from </span><code>pydantic.BaseModel</code><span>, MyPy fails the typechecking, with an error that looks like </span><code>src/my_file.py:12: error: Class cannot subclass 'BaseModel' (has type 'Any')</code><span>. But I know that </span><code>BaseModel</code><span> doesn't have type </span><code>Any</code><span> and so does </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/" target="_blank">PyCharm</a><span>, so why doesn't MyPy?</span></p><p><span>Turns out, there's a plugin for MyPy to fix this. It's documented pretty well in the </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/mypy_plugin/" target="_blank">Pydantic docs</a><span> (which are awesome!), but I failed to read them, and wasn't pointed there when I tried googling my error messages. So, I needed to add a config file for MyPy, and add this plugin:</span></p><pre class="language-ini"><code class="language-ini"># mypy.ini
[mypy]
plugins = pydantic.mypy

[pydantic-mypy]
init_forbid_extra = True
init_typed = True
warn_required_dynamic_aliases = True
warn_untyped_fields = True
</code></pre><p><span>The first section adds the plugin, and the second turns on some options to make the checking even more strict. See </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/mypy_plugin/#plugin-settings" target="_blank">the Pydantic docs</a><span> for what these settings actually do.</span></p><p><span>So now the MyPy settings are in place, if I run the type checker again, I get an error that Pydantic isn't installed. This is true, since we run MyPy from a stripped-down </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">tox</a><span> environment with only the linter, formatters and MyPy itself installed. Let's fix that. The relevant section of the (really rather long) </span><code>tox.ini</code><span> file needs to look like:</span></p><pre class="language-ini"><code class="language-ini">[base]
lint_targets = src tests

[testenv:lint]
description = Lint using black, flake8 and isort. Type-check using Mypy.
deps =
    black
    flake8
    isort
    mypy
    pydantic # add this! or put it in a requirements.txt and install from there
commands =
    isort --check-only --diff {[base]lint_targets}
    black --check --diff {[base]lint_targets}
    flake8 {[base]lint_targets}
    mypy --ignore-missing-imports --strict {toxinidir}/src
    mypy --ignore-missing-imports {toxinidir}/tests/unit
</code></pre><p><span>And yay! everything works!</span></p></section><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-2"><h2 class="firn-headline firn-headline-2" id="afterword"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Afterword</span></span></h2><section><p><span>This section of </span><code>tox.ini</code><span> includes a couple of my favourite Python tools, which I thought might be worth a mention:</span></p><ul><li><p><a class="firn-external" href="https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" target="_blank">black</a><span> for automatically formatting code. I don't love the style of the formatting it does, but I absolutely do love the lack of configurability - I have better things to do with my day than argue with my team about formatting
  conventions.</span></p></li><li><p><a class="firn-external" href="https://readthedocs.org/projects/isort/" target="_blank">isort</a><span> for sorting your import statements. This has a million configuration options, but the company has a default set to use so I personally don't have to think about it. While PyCharm can do this, not everyone on my team uses it,
  and I often forget to run formatting anyways, so having something that will just fix things is great.</span></p></li></ul><p><span>Basically, I'm a fan of anything that can automatically fix silly mistakes I make, and get code written by many people into a consistent style without arguments. We actually have a tox environment to do this fixing for us, with the relevant section of </span><code>tox.ini</code><span> looking like</span></p><pre class="language-ini"><code class="language-ini">[testenv:autoformat]
description = Autoformat all Python files using isort and black.
deps =
    black
    isort[pyproject]
commands =
    isort {[base]lint_targets}
    black --verbose {[base]lint_targets}
</code></pre><p><span>Personally I'd rather this was a </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks" target="_blank">pre-commit hook</a><span> so I couldn't forget to run it, but that's a problem for another day.</span></p></section></div></div></article></main></body></html>
