TODO write a post explaining what is true now!</span></p><p><span>This thing is made using </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://svelte.dev/" target="_blank">svelte</a><span> and </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://sapper.svelte.dev/" target="_blank">sapper</a><span>. It starts from the </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper-template" target="_blank">sapper template</a><span> and steals a bunch of things from </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://github.com/22mahmoud/mahmoudashraf.dev" target="_blank">this GitHub repo</a><span>. It's pretty bare-bones for now, but I really just wanted something simple where I could understand all the parts. The theme is based on </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://draculatheme.com/" target="_blank">Dracula</a><span>, which I use for everything possible.</span></p><p><span>I don't really do anything to do with web programming at all, so this is all pretty new to me. However, I'm working on a web project with some friends that uses these technologies, so figured I'd better learn something about how they work.</span></p><p><span>I'm planning to write random ramblings about all kinds of things. Programming mostly, since that's what I do for work, and I'm always learning things which current me wishes past me wrote down somewhere. But also maybe knitting, linguistics, </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://www.instagram.com/malmandlack/" target="_blank">guinea pigs</a><span> and sketchnotes. Or some crazy mashup of them all, who knows.</span></p><p><span>Expect the writing to be rough and somewhat stream of consciousness - I'm aiming to capture thought processes and learnings rather than write a novel.</span></p></section></div></article></main></body></html>
